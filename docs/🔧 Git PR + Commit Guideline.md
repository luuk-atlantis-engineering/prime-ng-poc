# 🔧 Git PR + Commit Guideline

Git documentation:  [https://git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)

## ✅ **Recommended Branch Pattern**

Always create your branch from the `development` working branch.

Use a clear, consistent naming convention to track purpose and ticket ID.

### 🔸 **Branch Name Format:**

```bash
<baseBranch>_<ticketNumber>-<short-description>
```

**Where:**

- `<baseBranch>` is the source branch you're working from (`main`, `develop`, etc.)
- `<ticketNumber>` is the tracking ID from your ticket system (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- `<short-description>` is a concise, kebab-case summary of what the ticket is about (no spaces, all lowercase)

### ✅ **Examples:**

```bash
develop_1234-add-language-selector
main_5678-fix-login-validation
release_4321-remove-legacy-api-calls
```

### 🔸 **Why This Pattern?**

- Keeps branches easy to trace to specific tickets.
- Makes pull requests self-explanatory.
- Helps avoid duplicate or conflicting branch names.
- Enables consistent automation or filtering in CI tools.

Avoid vague or messy names like `fix1`, `temp`, `test-update`, etc. These will be rejected during review.


## ✅ **Commit Message Convention**

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. This makes commit history readable, automates changelogs, and enables cleaner versioning/releases.

### 🔸 **Format**

```
(#<issue id>) <type>: <short, imperative summary>
```

- **`<issue id>`** is the id of the issue from whichever tool is used (e.g. GitHub Projects)
- **`<type>`** describes the kind of change you're making.
- **Summary** should be brief, clear, and written in imperative mood (e.g., *"add"*, not *"added"*).

### 🔸 **Allowed Commit Types**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | A new feature or UI component |
| `fix` | A bug fix (logic, styling, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code restructure that doesn’t change behavior |
| `chore` | Tooling, config changes, build scripts, dependency bumps |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style` | Formatting changes (e.g., spacing, semicolons, no logic impact) |

---

### ✅ **Good Commit Examples**

```bash
(#364) feat: add language switch to header
(#364) fix: handle null pointer in login service
(#364) refactor: simplify user permissions check
(#364) chore: update angular to version 20
(#364) docs: update README with setup steps
(#364) test: add integration test for language selector
(#364) style: fix spacing in app.module.ts
```

---

### 🔸 **Why This Matters**

- Makes it easy to understand what each commit does at a glance.
- Forces commits to be single responsibility instead of affecting multiple project areas.
- Enables automated changelogs and semantic versioning if needed.
- Enforces consistency across the team

---

## 🔁 **Merge Strategy**

We use **Merge commits** to preserve full commit history for traceability — no rebase, no squash merges. This keeps all work visible and avoids silently rewriting commit history, especially when debugging or auditing later.

### 🔸 Rules:

- **Do NOT rebase** your feature branch on top of `main` or `development`.
- **Do NOT squash** commits in the PR UI.
- Always select **"Create a merge commit"** when merging a PR.

---

### 🔸 Keeping your feature branch up to date

If `development` has moved ahead while you’re working, **merge it into your branch** — do not rebase.

```bash
git checkout development
git pull

git checkout development_1234-add-language-selector
git merge development
```

Resolve any conflicts **in the feature branch**, not on `development`.

---

### 🔸 Merging your branch into the main branch (via PR)

After approval and tests pass:

```bash
git checkout development
git pull
git merge development_1234-add-language-selector
```

Push, then open a PR to `main` (or `development`, depending on your flow). In the PR, use a descriptive merge commit message.

✅ **Merge Commit Title Format:**

```
feat: Add language selector to header
```

## 🧼 Cleanup (Post-merge)

After merge:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d develop_1234-add-language-selector
```

---

## ✅ **Pull Request Quality Checklist**

Ensure the following before submitting a PR:

### 🔸 PR Title & Branch

- Title clearly reflects the feature/fix.
- Branch name follows pattern: `mainBranchName_{ticketNo}-ticket-description`.

### 🔸 Ticket Reference

- Link to ticket (e.g., Jira, Linear) is included and visible in the PR description.

### 🔸 PR Description

- Clearly explains **what was added or changed**.
- Includes **how to test** the changes manually or via integration test.
- Mentions **any known gaps, TODOs, or edge cases** (if applicable).

### 🔸 Clean Working Tree

- No leftover `console.log`, `.only`, or `commented code`
- No temporary/misc files accidentally committed (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `debug.js`, etc.).

### 🔸 Code Standards

- Lint passes: `npm run lint`.   @George Vlachos <todo: check configuration during MVP>
- Build succeeds locally: `npm run build`.
- Translation keys follow `ngx-translate` naming convention (e.g., `component.element.action`).

## ⛔ Don’t

- Don’t push directly to `main` or `develop`.
- Don’t rebase or squash commits in shared branches.
- Don’t name branches `fix1`, `hotfix-final`, or similar.
- Don’t skip the ticket link in PRs.
- Don’t skip Documentation & Tests if needed


## 🔍 **Code Review Expectations**

Code review is more than just scanning code — it validates **logic**, **structure**, and **intent**. Below is what each role must focus on during both **Ticket Creation** and **Code Review**.

### 👨‍💻 Developers

### **Ticket Responsibilities**

- Ensure acceptance criteria are complete and specific.
- Clarify edge cases or undefined behavior before implementation.
- Flag any missing design or business logic early.

### **Code Review Responsibilities**

- Confirm all translation keys follow the [Translation Contributing Guidelines](https://chatgpt.com/c/680b666f-dc8c-8001-a9ba-915fbb035fa3#).
- Enforce consistent use of TypeScript types — no `any`.
- Reject duplicated logic; services/utilities must be reused.
- Validate structure (inputs/outputs, modularity, service isolation).
- Check for unintended side effects (global state, layout shifts).
- Require integration tests for UI behavior that spans multiple components or services.
- Confirm test coverage exists or is clearly unnecessary (with justification).

### 🎨 Designers

### **Ticket Responsibilities**

- Attach final and relevant designs (Figma or similar).
- Annotate dynamic behavior, animation expectations, or edge interactions.
- Indicate if a design is open to developer interpretation.

### **Code Review Responsibilities**

- Review that implemented UI aligns visually and behaviorally with the design.
- Confirm responsiveness and accessibility (keyboard/touch/screen reader basics).
- Validate that placeholder text and content areas are present and structured for translation.


### 💼 Business (Product/PO)

### **Ticket Responsibilities**

- Ensure all functional expectations are captured (not assumed).
- Write or review acceptance criteria — must be testable.
- Identify business rules, roles, or permission constraints.
- Flag priorities and deadlines clearly.

### **Code Review Responsibilities**

- Confirm implementation aligns with business intent.
- Validate that labels, messages, and flows match expected behavior.
- Ensure all edge conditions and error handling are covered.
- Flag any missing functionality not caught by dev/test/design.

---

### 📌 Final Note

In soft agile, reviews are collaborative. Developers **own the implementation**, Designers own **visual correctness**, and Business owns **functional validation**.

If any of these three fails, the PR is not ready to merge.
